# ib-re-actor

A clojure friendly wrapper around the Interactive Brokers java API.

## Usage

I don't have permission to redistribute Interactive Broker's jars, so this is a little cludgey:

1. Fetch the source code for ib-re-actor from github:

```bash
> git clone http://github.com/cbilson/ib-re-actor
```

2. Download the Interactive Brokers "IB API Software" from
http://individuals.interactivebrokers.com/en/p.php?f=programInterface&ib_entity=llc. Follow
the instructions to unpack it. Use maven to install the jtsclient.jar
with groupId 'com.ib', artifactId 'jtsclient', and version '9.68'. For me, this went like:

```bash
> cd ~/Downloads

> jar xf twsapi_unixmac_968.jar

> mvn install:install-file -Dfile=IBJts/jtsclient.jar -DgroupId=com.ib -DartifactId=jtsclient -Dversion=9.68 -Dpackaging=jar
```

You can use ib-re-actor either with IB Trader Workstation or with IB
Gateway. Personally, I have the gateway running on a linux server that
I use VNC to connect to when I need to start/restart the gateway
component. I then run programs on that machine that connect to it
locally. It would be nice if there were a way to run the gateway
without X and without having to authenticate, but alas, that's not how
it works.
