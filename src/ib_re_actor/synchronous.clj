  "Functions for doing things with interactive brokers in a synchronous manner.
   Mostly these are just wrappers that create a temporary handler function,

   interactive context (such as when using the REPL) but probably not what you
   would want to use in an application, as the asynchronous API is a much more
   natural fit for building programs that react to events in market data."
