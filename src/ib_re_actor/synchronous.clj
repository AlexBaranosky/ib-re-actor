  "Functions for doing things with interactive brokers in a synchronous manner.
   Mostly these are just wrappers that create a temporary handler function,
   wait for a response, then unsubscribe. These are much easier to use in an
   interactive context (such as when using the REPL) but probably not what you
   would want to use in an application, as the asynchronous API is a much more
   natural fit for building programs that react to events in market data."
