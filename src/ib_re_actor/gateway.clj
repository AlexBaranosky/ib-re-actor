;; # The Gateway
;; The main user interface. Functions for connecting to Interactive Brokers TWS Gateway and sending
;; requests to it.
;;
;; ## Big Picture
;; The IB API requires consumers to instantate an object of type com.ib.client.EClientSocket
;; which is a socket client to the gateway, or TWS.  When instantating this object you pass in
;; another object which must implement the com.ib.client.EWrapper interface.  The EWrapper is a
;; collection of callbacks. You then invoke
;; methods (like requesting price data) on the the EClientSocket object and the results
;; (price update events) is returned by the EWrapper callbacks.
;; So the typical pattern for dealing with the IB API is to implement an EWrapper type object for each
;; application, which requires a lot of knowledge of the API.
;;
;; This library takes a slightly different approach to try ease that burden.  The library implements a listener framework
;; around each callback in the EWrapper object.  So what happens is that each time the IB Gateway
;; calls back to an method in the EWrapper, our object parses the response and packages it up into a tidy Clojure map
;; which its hands to any registered listeners.
;;
;; Consumers of this library thus do not need to care about the mechanics of EWrapper, ESocketClient etc,
;; they simply need to register a listener and will receive events.
;;
;; ## Basic Usage
;; 1. Connect to a running Gateway of TWS, using the connect function
;; 2. Register a listener for an event using the subscribe function
;; 3. Request the generation of the appropriate event using the request-* functions
;; 4. Cancel the request with the cancel-* when done.
